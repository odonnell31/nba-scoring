Exploratory Data Analysis of NBA scoring from 1996-2016.

This exploratory data analysis investigates if and how scoring has changed in the NBA throughout the past 20 seasons (1996-97 to 2015-26).
To investigate, I explored the data to display scoring as a whole and scoring over time.
Usually, I use the variable Pts, which is actually a players average Points Per Game over a Season. Hope you enjoy!
