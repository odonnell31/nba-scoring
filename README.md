# NBA Scoring

Exploratory Data Analysis of NBA scoring from 1996-2016.

This project uses exploratory data analysis to investigate if and how scoring has changed in the NBA in the twenty seasons from 1996-97 to 2015-16. The project uses many NBA statistics other than scoring to check for correlations and such. The project makes final assessments primarily based on visualizations.

Below is an example of a visualization in this project:
